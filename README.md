Resume Analyzer - Level 1 Basic


🚀 Resume Skill Matching System
🔍 A Flask-Based ATS Simulation



📌 Overview

This project is a Resume–Job Description Matching System built using Python and Flask.

It simulates how an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) evaluates resumes by:

Extracting predefined skills

Comparing them against job requirements

Calculating a match percentage

Displaying matched and missing skills visually


🎯 Problem Statement

Recruiters often receive hundreds of resumes for a single job posting.

Manual screening:

⏳ Time-consuming

❌ Error-prone

📉 Inconsistent

This system automates skill comparison using structured keyword evaluation.

⚙️ Internal Working (Step-by-Step)

1️⃣ Skill Definition (skills1.py)

Defines evaluation criteria:

SKILLS = [
    "python",
    "java",
    "sql",
    "nlp",
    "c",
    "c++",
    "c#"
]


Only skills listed here are evaluated.

2️⃣ Skill Extraction (skill_extractor.py)

Converts text to lowercase

Sorts skills by length (longest first)

Uses regex word-boundary matching

Prevents overlapping matches

Handles special cases like:

C

C++

C#

Example:

pattern = r'\b' + escaped_skill + r'\b'


Prevents:

❌ "c" matching inside "machine"

❌ "java" matching inside "javascript"


3️⃣ Score Calculation (score_calculator.py)
match_percentage = (matched / total_required) * 100


Returns:

{
  "percentage": 66.67,
  "matched": [...],
  "missing": [...]
}


4️⃣ Flask Application (app1.py)


Handles:

Input validation

Whitespace-only protection

Skill extraction

Score calculation

Result rendering

📊 Example
Job Description
Looking for Python developer with SQL and NLP skills.

Resume
Experienced in Python and SQL.

Output

🚧 Current Limitations

Keyword-based only

No synonym recognition (AI ≠ Artificial Intelligence)

No semantic similarity

No experience weighting


🔮 Roadmap
